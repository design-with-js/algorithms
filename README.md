Problem solving activity with javascript/es6

Any contribution in the form of new problems/solutions is most welcome.
Clone and start adding your algorithm question practice if you've been doing it in javascript.
If you need a solution to any problem that you've been asked in the interview or a live coding program,
feel free to create a problems folder in the base directory and request for solutions, I will personally try
to solve them on my own and push the solution as soon as possible.

I see many javascript developers having to go through screening DS-algorithm rounds in any interview process, and
developers struggle to find a working solution in javascript on major coding platforms like codechef and hackerrank.

This is just my small initiative to not just help myself but many other js-lovers to find a well planned structured study
material for ds-algo practice to prepare for interviews, which keeps on growing with new sets of problems and their solutions.

TODOs:

1. Adding a problems folder to make a proper question bank for the developers.

2. Fragmentation of the src/ and problems/ directories into different sections based on the ds-alo topic that problem relates to.

3. Cover all the probems with unit test cases.
